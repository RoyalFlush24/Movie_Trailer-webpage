# Movie Trailer Website
As part of Udacity full stack web developer program, I am require to write a README file. There's couple of ways to run the program.
# Instructions
Before we get started we use a program called fresh_tomatoes.py to help us run the web page, it can easily be downloaded online via a google search. The program fresh_tomatoes help us display our code in an HTML format. It requre python 2.7.x and above in order to run. 
* You can download python 2.7.x or 3.6.x [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to help you see the code in its raw format. 
* The source code for the program can be obtain at https://github.com/RoyalFlush24/Movie_Trailer-webpage.
* Next you can either clone or download this repository to get all necessary files needed to see the movie trailer web page.
Once you finish with those steps next thing to do is to unzip all the files and save them into your machine's directory. (CAUTION) follow system documentation on how to do this.
