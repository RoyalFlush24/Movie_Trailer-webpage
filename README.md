# Movie Trailer Website
As part of Udacity full stack web developer program, I am require to write a README file. Here are my instruction on how to get it to run on your machine.
# Instructions
Before we get started we use a program called fresh_tomatoes.py to help us run the web page, it can easily be downloaded online via a google search or you can get it from this repository. The program fresh_tomatoes help us display our code in an HTML format. It requre python 2.7.x and above in order to run. 
* You can download python 2.7.x or 3.6.x [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to help you see the code in its raw format. 
* The source code for the program can be obtain at https://github.com/RoyalFlush24/Movie_Trailer-webpage.
* Next you can either clone or download this repository to get all necessary files needed to see the movie trailer web page.

Once you finish with those steps next thing to do is to unzip all the files and save them into your machine's directory. (CAUTION) follow system documentation on how to do this.
At this point you should have everything you need in order to get started, python, fresh_tomatoes.py, media.py, entertainment_center.py. All these should be store in a folder called movie.
Now you can open up your files using python to run the module and see the webpage or you can use terminal or cmd to do so. To run it using terminal and/or cmd you must go to the directory where the file movie is saved in once there open up the movie file, next use the command python entertainment_center.py to open up the the browser for the the movie trailer.
